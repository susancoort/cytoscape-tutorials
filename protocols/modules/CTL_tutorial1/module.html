	Extend a set of microRNAs with regulatory information
</section>
<section>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
CyTargetLinker provides a quick and extensive enrichment of biological networks in Cytoscape. The visualization options allow biological interpretation of complex regulatory networks in a graphical way.

In this tutorial a step-by-step explanation is given on how to extend a list of microRNAs with predicted and validated microRNA-target interactions (MTIs).

<h1>Step 1a: Import a set of microRNAs into Cytoscape</h1>
<img style="float:right;width:50%" src="protocols/modules/CTL_Tutorial1/Import-microRNA.jpg">
<ul style="width:45%">
	<li>First you will need to create a biological network in Cytoscape 3.x containing your microRNAs of interest.</li>
	<li>The datafile should contain at least two columns, (i) the microRNA name and (ii) the corresponding miRBase accession number.</li>
	<li>An example datafile, in which two microRNAs known to be involved in obesity are listed, can be found <a href="http://projects.bigcat.unimaas.nl/data/cytargetlinker/resources/microRNAs.xlsx"  microRNA>here</a> </li>
	<li>Open the datafile containing the microRNAs in Cytoscape via File -> Import -> Network ->File.</li>
	<li>First you select the network file that you want to load into Cytoscape. Thereafter a panel becomes visible were you should select the column with microRNA names as the source interaction and transfer the header of the column as attribute names, as shown on your right.</li>
</ul>

<h1> Step 1b: microRNA network</h1>
The resulting biological network of two microRNAs from the example data, as shown in the figure.

<h1>Step 2a:What are linksets?</h1>
<ul>
	<li>A linkset is a network containing regulatory interactions that are usually derived from an online interaction resources.</li> 
	<li>The networks are stored in XGMML (the eXtensible Graph Markup and Modeling Language)format, which is supported by Cytoscape.</li> 
	<li>Each interaction consists of two nodes, a source and target biomolecule, connected through one directed edge.</li>
	<li>Several linkset for different species and interaction types are provided.<li>

	<li>However CyTargetLinker is not limited to the provided linksets. A user can also create their own linksets.</li> 
	<li>A detailed description on how to create your own linkset will soon be available as a tutorial.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h1>Step 2b: Download the microRNA-target gene linkset</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Before starting CyTargetLinker you need to download the linksets here and store them in a directory</li>
	<li>The linksets provided on the CyTargetLinker website are species-specific</li> 
	<li>In this tutorial the human linksets are needed. Download homo spanies collection</li>
</ul

<h1>Step 3: Built regulatory network in Cytoscape</h1>

</section>
<section>
<h1>Step 4: Adapt visualization options</h1>
Install the CyTargetLinker app via the app manager in Cytoscape version 3.0 and higher

Open the CyTargetLinker in Cytoscape via Apps -> CyTargetLinker and select Extend network. Thereafter the CyTargetLinker selection panel is displayed.
