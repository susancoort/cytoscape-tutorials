	Extend a set of microRNAs with regulatory information
</section>
<section>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
CyTargetLinker provides a quick and extensive enrichment of biological networks in Cytoscape. The visualization options allow biological interpretation of complex regulatory networks in a graphical way.

In this tutorial a step-by-step explanation is given on how to extend a list of microRNAs with predicted and validated microRNA-target interactions (MTIs).

<h1>Step 1a: Import a set of microRNAs into Cytoscape</h1>
<img style="float:right;width:50%" src="protocols/modules/CTL_Tutorial1/Import-microRNA.jpg">
<ul style="width:45%">
	<li>First you will need to create a biological network in Cytoscape 3.x containing your microRNAs of interest.</li>
	<li>The datafile should contain at least two columns, (i) the microRNA name and (ii) the corresponding miRBase accession number.</li>
	<li>An example datafile, in which two microRNAs known to be involved in obesity are listed, can be found <a href="http://projects.bigcat.unimaas.nl/data/cytargetlinker/resources/microRNAs.xlsx"  microRNA>here</a> </li>
	<li>Open the datafile containing the microRNAs in Cytoscape via File -> Import -> Network ->File.</li>
	<li>First you select the network file that you want to load into Cytoscape. Thereafter a panel becomes visible were you should select the column with microRNA names as the source interaction and transfer the header of the column as attribute names, as shown on your right.</li>
</ul>

<h1> Step 1b: microRNA network</h1>
The resulting biological network of two microRNAs from the example data, as shown in the figure.

<h1>Step 2a:What are linksets?</h1>
<ul>
	<li>A linkset is a network containing regulatory interactions that are usually derived from an online interaction resources.</li> 
	<li>The networks are stored in XGMML (the eXtensible Graph Markup and Modeling Language)format, which is supported by Cytoscape.</li> 
	<li>Each interaction consists of two nodes, a source and target biomolecule, connected through one directed edge.</li>
	<li>Several linkset for different species and interaction types are provided.<li>

	<li>However CyTargetLinker is not limited to the provided linksets. A user can also create their own linksets.</li> 
	<li>A detailed description on how to create your own linkset will soon be available as a tutorial.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<h1>Step 2b: Download the microRNA-target gene linkset</h1>
<img style="float:right;width:50%" src="modules/CTL_Tutorial1/CTL_Linksets.jpg">
<ul style="width:45%">
	<li>Before starting CyTargetLinker you need to download the linksets <a href="https://projects.bigcat.unimaas.nl/cytargetlinker/linksets/"  linksets>here</a> and store them in a directory</li>
	<li>The linksets provided on the CyTargetLinker website are species-specific</li> 
	<li>In this tutorial the human linksets are needed. Download Homo Sapiens collection</li>
</ul

<h1>Step 3a: Built regulatory network in Cytoscape</h1>
<img style="float:right;width:50%" src="modules/CTL_Tutorial1/CTL_Display-panel.jpg">
<ul style="width:45%">
	<li>Install the CyTargetLinker app via the app manager in Cytoscape version 3.0 and higher</li>
	<li>Open the CyTargetLinker in Cytoscape via Apps -> CyTargetLinker -> Extend network</li>
	<li>Thereafter the CyTargetLinker selection panel is displayed </li>
	
	<li> 1. Select the user network. This is the biological network you want to extend with regulatory information. Here we select the human microRNAs.</li>
	<li> 2. Select the network attribute. This is the column containing the identifier which is supported by CyTargetLinker. The supported identifiers are listed in overview of the linksets a href="https://projects.bigcat.unimaas.nl/cytargetlinker/linksets/regins-mirtarbase/"  linksets>here</a> . For the microRNAs we recommend to use the miRBase accession numbers.</li>
	<li> 3. Select the directory containing the species specific linksets which you downloaded in step 2b.</li>
	<li> 4. Select the direction of the interaction. The user can decide how he wants to extend the network, i.e., a) add targets,  b) add sources or  3) both (default). Here we add only the targets of the microRNAs.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Step 3b: Built regulatory network in Cytoscape</h1>
<img style="float:right;width:50%" src="modules/CTL_Tutorial1/Select_MTIs.jpg">
<ul style="width:45%">
	<li>Click ok en thereafter select the RINs containing microRNA-target information</li> 
	<li>In this case we have three resources containing microRNA-target interactions, i.e., microCosm, miRTarBase and TargetScan </li>
</ul>

<h1>Step 3c: Regulatory network in Cytoscape</h1>
<img style="float:right;width:50%" src="modules/CTL_Tutorial1/Resulting_extended_network.jpg">
<ul style="width:45%">
	<li>The extended network is now visualized in a new Cytoscape network</li>
	<li>To visualize the microRNA names and gene names in the network go to View -> Show Graphical Details</li>
	<li>In the network microRNAs and target genes are defined as grey circles and pink hexagons, respectively</li> 
	<li>To show the CyTargetLinker results panel go to Apps -> CyTargetLinker -> Show results panel</li>
	<li>The predicted MTIs are visualized in red (microCosm: 1543) and blue (TargetScan: 2550) and the validated MTIs in purple (miRTarBase: 26), as shown in the results panel on the right hand site.</li> 
	<li>The color of the edges can be adapted in the results panel by clicking on the color</li>
</ul>

<h1>Step 4a: Adapt visualization options</h1>
The visualization options in CyTartgetLinker make is possible to investigate the regulatory network in more detail.

<h2>Hide and show functionality</h2>
<img style="float:right;width:50%" src="modules/CTL_Tutorial1/Hide_predicted-MTIs.jpg">
<ul style="width:45%">
	<li>It is possible to hide or show specific linksets</li>
	<li>Here we are interested in only the validated MTIs. Go to the results panel and hide the linksets containing predicted MTI, i.e., TargetScan and MicroCosm, by clicking on the dropdown menu.</li> 
	<li>Now only the linksets from miRTarbase are shown in the network and the layout is immediately adapted</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h1>Step 4b: Adapt visualization options</h1>
The visualization options in CyTartgetLinker make is possible to investigate the regulatory network in more detail.

<h2>Threshold functionality</h2>
<img style="float:right;width:50%" src="modules/CTL_Tutorial1/Hide_predicted-MTIs.jpg">
<ul style="width:45%">
	<li>It is possible to show interactions that are present in at least a specific number of linksets</li>
	<li>Here we are interested in MTIs that are present in at least 2 linksets</li> 
	<li>Go to the CyTargeLinker-panel, make sure all the linksets are shown, and set the overlap threshold to 2</li>
	<li>Now the overlap between the linksets is shown and the layout is immediately adapted</li>
	<li>Per linkset it is indicated first how many interactions are still present when applying a threshold of 2 and the second number represent the total number of interactions were added to the original network</li>
</ul>
