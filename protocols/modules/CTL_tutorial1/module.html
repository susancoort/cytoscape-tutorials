	Extend a set of microRNAs with regulatory information
</section>
<section>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
CyTargetLinker provides a quick and extensive enrichment of biological networks in Cytoscape. The visualization options allow biological interpretation of complex regulatory networks in a graphical way.

In this tutorial a step-by-step explanation is given on how to extend a list of microRNAs with predicted and validated microRNA-target interactions (MTIs).

<h1>Step 1a: Import a set of microRNAs into Cytoscape</h1>
<img style="float:right;width:30%" src="modules/CTL_Tutorial1/Import-microRNA.png">
<ul style="width:45%">
	<li>First you will need to create a biological network in Cytoscape 3.x containing your microRNAs of interest.</li>
	<li>The datafile should contain at least two columns, (i) the microRNA name and (ii) the corresponding miRBase accession number.</li>
	<li>An example datafile, in which two microRNAs known to be involved in obesity are listed, can be found <a href="http://projects.bigcat.unimaas.nl/data/cytargetlinker/resources/microRNAs.xlsx"  here></a> </li>
	<li>Open the datafile containing the microRNAs in Cytoscape via File -> Import -> Network ->File.</li>
	<li>First you select the network file that you want to load into Cytoscape. Thereafter a panel becomes visible were you should select the column with microRNA names as the source interaction and transfer the header of the column as attribute names, as shown on your right.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Step 2: Download the microRNA-target gene linkset</h1>
A linkset is a network containing regulatory interactions that are usually derived from an online interaction resources. 
The networks are stored in XGMML (the eXtensible Graph Markup and Modeling Language)format, which is supported by Cytoscape. 
Each regulatory interaction consists of two nodes, a source (regulatory component) and target biomolecule, connected through one directed edge. 
Several linkset for different species and interaction types are provided.

However CyTargetLinker is not limited to the provided linksets. A user can also create their own linksets. A detailed description on how to create your own linkset will soon be available as a tutorial.

Before starting CyTargetLinker you need to download the linksets here and store them in a directory. The linksets provided on the CyTargetLinker website are species-specific. In this tutorial the human linksets are needed. Download all the linksets for homo sapiens, depicted in Figure 5
